In this article, we will show you some of the features and benefits of MTC Pronest 8.02.01 and how to use it effectively for your nesting needs.
 
## What is MTC Pronest 8.02.01?
 
MTC Pronest 8.02.01 is a CAD/CAM nesting software developed by Hypertherm, a U.S.-based manufacturer of industrial cutting systems and software. It is designed to work with any cutting machine and any cutting process, including plasma, laser, waterjet, and oxyfuel.
 
MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can import parts from any CAD system or create them directly in the software using its built-in drawing tools. It can also automatically apply kerf compensation, lead-in/out, pierce points, common-line cutting, bridge cutting, chain cutting, and other cutting parameters based on the machine and process settings.
 
MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can generate optimal nests for any sheet size, shape, or material type using its advanced nesting algorithms and customizable nesting strategies. It can also nest multiple jobs simultaneously using parallel processing to save time and resources.
 
MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can output NC code for any cutting machine and post-processor using its extensive library of machine profiles and post-processors. It can also integrate with your ERP/MRP system to import and export job information and material inventory.
 
## What are the Benefits of MTC Pronest 8.02.01?
 
MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can help you achieve several benefits for your cutting operations, such as:
 
- Increased material utilization: MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can reduce scrap and increase yield by using its PlateSaver technology that combines the arc stability of X-Definition plasma with specialized software parameters to cut mild steel more efficiently.[^1^] It can also use remnant sheets, skeleton cut-up, part rotation, part mirroring, part grouping, and other techniques to maximize material usage.
- Reduced production time: MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can speed up your nesting process by using its parallel processing feature that allows you to nest multiple jobs at the same time using multiple processor cores.[^2^] It can also use its Production Manager feature that lets you preview nests before cutting, export jobs to Excel for scheduling, and locate duplicate nests for consolidation.[^1^]
- Improved cutting quality: MTC Pronest 8.02.01 can enhance your cutting quality by using its ProNest LT package that includes a trial version of ProNest2023 LT, a more advanced CAD/CAM nesting software that offers more features and capabilities.[^2^] It can also use its SureCut technology that provides optimal cut settings for plasma cutting machines based on material type, thickness, gas type, torch height, etc.[^1^]

## How to Use MTC Pronest 8.02.01?
 
To use MTC Pronest 8.02.01 effectively for your nesting needs, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install MTC Pronest 8.02.01 on your computer and activate it with a license key.[^2^]
2. Create or import parts into MTC Pronest 8.02.01 using its drawing tools or CAD import feature.[^2^]
3. Apply cutting parameters to your parts based on your machine and process settings.[^2^]
4. Select a sheet size, shape, and material type for your nest.[^2^ 0f148eb4a0
